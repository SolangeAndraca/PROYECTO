            <p>
                <span class="p__span1">O</span>n August 13, 1961, the Communist government of the German Democratic Republic (GDR, or East Germany) began to build a barbed wire and concrete “Antifascistischer Schutzwall,” or “antifascist bulwark,” between East and West Berlin. The official purpose of this Berlin Wall was to keep so-called Western “fascists” from entering East Germany and undermining the socialist state, but it primarily served the objective of stemming mass defections from East to West. <span class="p__span">The Berlin Wall stood until November 9, 1989</span>, when the head of the East German Communist Party announced that citizens of the GDR could cross the border whenever they pleased. That night, ecstatic crowds swarmed the wall. Some crossed freely into West Berlin, while others brought hammers and picks and began to chip away at the wall itself. 
                <span class="p__span">The reunification of East and West Germany was made official on October 3, 1990</span>, almost one year after the fall of the Berlin Wall.
                To this day, the Berlin Wall remains one of the most powerful and enduring symbols of the Cold War.

                <span class="p__span1">T</span><span class="p__span">he Brandenburg Gate</span> in Berlin is one of the most important landmarks of the metropolis. The only surviving city gate in Berlin, which used to stand primarily for the separation of the city into East and West, has been the symbol of German unity since the fall of the Wall . In addition, the sandstone building is one of the most beautiful examples of German classicism.
                <span class="p__span">It was built between 1788 and 1791</span> according to plans by Carl Gotthard Langhans at the request of the Prussian King Friedrich Wilhelm II.
                Since the division of Germany and the construction of the Wall in 1961, the Brandenburg Gate in East Berlin <span class="p__span">has been in the restricted area</span> , the Berlin Wall ran in an arc around the gate on the western side, which became a memorial for the division of Germany.
                When Ronald Reagan gave a speech next to the Wall in 1987, he said <span class="p__span">“Mr. Gorbachev, open this gate! Mr Gorbachev, tear down this wall!”</span>
                Two years later: after the Wall came down, 100,000 people attended the official opening on December 22, 1989 and shortly thereafter celebrated the first New Year's Eve together. The symbolism has also changed: Today, the Brandenburg Gate stands like no other landmark for the reunified Germany .

            <p>
                <span class="p__span1">I</span>n honour of Wilhelm I, the first German Kaiser, his grandson Wilhelm II planned a magnificent church, which <span class="p__span">was built by Franz Schwechten between 1891 and 1895 in the Neo-Romantic style</span>. With five spires, the bombastic design reflected the tastes of the time and that of the Kaiser.
                Air raids in 1943 damaged the church so badly that the top of the main spire broke off and the roof collapsed. At the end of the war, the Allies were unwilling to rebuild it, since it had been a symbol of excessive national pride. <span class="p__span">The ruin stood as a constant reminder to Berliners of the horrors of war.</span>
                The memorial hall in the old spire is now a memorial against war and destruction and a symbol of reconciliation.<span class="p__span">It also contains a crucifix made of nails from the burnt roof timbers of Coventry Cathedral</span>, which was almost completely destroyed by bombs in 1940.
                The church has been undergoing extensive renovation for several years. From 2009 to 2015 the old spire was hidden under thick tarpaulins. The new spire and chapel are next in line.

            <p>
                <span class="p__span1">I</span>t was the first new concentration camp to be established following the appointment of Reich Leader SS Heinrich Himmler as the Chief of the German Police in July 1936.  <span class="p__span">More than 200,000 people were interned</span> in Sachsenhausen concentration camp,
                they included political opponents of the Nazi regime, members of groups declared by the Nazis to be racially or biologically inferior, such as Jews, Sinti and Roma, and people persecuted as homosexuals, as well as so-called “career criminals” and “antisocials”.
                <span class="p__span">Tens of thousands of internees died</span> in the camp as a result of hunger, disease, forced labour, medical experiments and mistreatment or were the victims of systematic extermination operations by the SS.
                <span class="p__span">The evacuation of the camp began in the early hours of 21 April 1945</span>. More than 30,000 remaining internees were marched off in groups towards the north-west. <span class="p__span">Units of the Soviet and Polish armies finally liberated around 3,000 sick internees</span> as well as nurses and doctors who had been left behind in the camp.
                300 of the camp’s former inmates did not survive their liberation and died there as a result of their incarceration in the concentration camp

            <p>
                <span class="p__span1">T</span>he Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe is better known as the Holocaust Memorial by most Berliners. <span class="p__span">Opened in May 2005</span>, the memorial in Berlin-Mitte is located near the Brandenburg Gate and is one of the city's most impressive sights.
                The Holocaust Memorial <span class="p__span">consists of an undulating field of 2711 concrete steles</span>, which can be passed through from all sides. While walking between the columns of different heights and the labyrinthine corridors, visitors may experience a brief moment of disorientation, which should open up space for discussion. Beneath the memorial is the Information Centre, which documents the crimes of the Nazi era in themed rooms.
                In June 1999, the Bundestag decided to build the Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe - which is the official name of the memorial - in the immediate vicinity of the Brandenburg Gate. After two years of construction, the memorial was ceremoniously opened on May 10, 2005. On a field of about 19,000 square meters, 2711 steles were installed - just as the design by the New York architect Peter Eisenman envisaged. The memorial is the central Holocaust memorial in Germany.

            <p>
                <span class="p__span1">L</span>ocated on the corner of Friedrichstraße and Zimmerstraße, <span class="p__span">it is a reminder of the former border crossing, the Cold War and the partition of Berlin</span>. The barrier and checkpoint booth, the flag and the sandbags are all based on the original site.
                The name Checkpoint Charlie comes from the NATO phonetic alphabet (Alpha, Bravo, Charlie). After the border crossings at Helmstedt-Marienborn (Alpha) and Dreilinden-Drewitz (Bravo), Checkpoint Charlie was the third checkpoint opened by the Allies in and around Berlin.<span class="p__span">In 1945 the allies divided Berlin into four sectors</span>: <span class="p__span">France</span> controlled the north-western, <span class="p__span">England</span> the western and the <span class="p__span">USA</span> the south-western parts of the city. The Soviet Union as allocated to the whole of the eastern part of Berlin.
                The checkpoint booth was removed on 22 June 1990, about half a year after the wall opened in November 1989. The original booth now displayed in the Allied Museum in Berlin-Zehlendorf. Later on a copy of the first guard house was built on the site of Checkpoint Charlie, a much smaller booth than the one removed in 1990.
                The pictures of the soldier at the site of Checkpoint Charlie today is the  former US army tuba player Jeff Harper.
