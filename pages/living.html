                The neighbourhoods in Berlin's east follow one rule: no two are alike! Whether you discover the castle of Frederick the Great's wife in cool Pankow, experience the "real slab" in Marzahn-Hellersdorf, <span class="p__span">visit Europe's largest zoo in Lichtenberg</span> or sail across the water in Treptow-Köpenick.
